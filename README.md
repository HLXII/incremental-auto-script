# Evolve-Autoscript
My personal userscript for the game Evolve by Demagorddon - https://pmotschmann.github.io/Evolve/

# Installation
Install the [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net) plugin. (I tried my script with Greasemonkey but it didn't work).

Goto this [page](https://github.com/HLXII/Evolve-Autoscript/raw/master/evolve_autoscript.user.js) to install the plugin. Tampermonkey should redirect you to an install page. Or just create a new script in Tampermonkey and copy/paste this script into the editor.

Make sure to toggle the Enable Script Support setting in the Settings tab, otherwise this script will not work.
