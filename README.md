# Incremental Game Autoscript
This contains my basic autoscript implementation for HTML-based incremental games. Individual game support will be in specific branches. The main branch will only contain the base autoscript implementation.

# Build
You can build the script using `npm run build`. This should generate the `*.user.js` userscript file.

# Installation
Install the [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net) plugin. Or some other userscript plugin, but be careful as some scripts may not work between plugins.

Goto this [page](https://github.com/HLXII/incremental-auto-script/raw/master/autoscript.user.js) to install the plugin. Tampermonkey should redirect you to an install page. Or just create a new script in Tampermonkey and copy/paste this script into the editor.
